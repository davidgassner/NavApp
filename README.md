# NavApp
This repository contains exercise files for the LinkedIn Learning course 
'Android Development: The Navigation Architecture Component', by David Gassner. The course is available at:

https://www.linkedin.com/learning/android-development-the-navigation-architecture-component

This repo was originally created with Android Studio 3.2, but it's been recently updated to work with 
Android Studio 4.0. If you use the exercise files with a more recent version of Android Studio, you'll need to update
the Gradle plugin and Kotlin version to match your version of Studio each time you check out a branch.
